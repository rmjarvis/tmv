\section{Changes from version \prevtmvversion\ to \tmvversion}
\label{Changes}

This release is mostly just some minor bug fixes.  Also, since Google Code went under,
TMV is now hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/rmjarvis/tmv.

Here is a list of the changes from version \prevtmvversion\ to \tmvversion.  
(See \S\ref{History} for changes from previous versions to \prevtmvversion\.)
%Whenever a change is not backward compatible, meaning that code using the previous version might be broken, I mark the item with a $\times$ bullet rather than the usual $\bullet$ to indicate this.  
This release is completely backwards compatible as far as the header files and library are 
concerned.  There are a couple (minor) new features, but the library should be link-compatible
with previous versions.

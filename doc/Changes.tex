\section{Changes from version \prevtmvversion\ to \tmvversion}
\label{Changes}

This release fixes some compiling issues with g++-14.  Specifically that it doesn't
allow \texttt{complex<int>} to be copied to \texttt{complex<long double>} without
explicit conversion.  There is no change to any functionality.

For the full history of changes prior to version \tmvversion\ see \S\ref{History}.

// Note - This file is the license file for the GASNet software package.
// I am only using the file portable_platform.h from that package.
// So the below statement about all files in the directory being 
// covered by this license is not correct.  The license only covers
// the file portable_platform.h.  I just figured it was better to put
// this comment at the start, rather than change the original text.
// 
// This file is normally called license.txt as part of the GASNet software 
// package, which can be found at http://gasnet.cs.berkeley.edu/

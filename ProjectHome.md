### TMV is a linear algebra class library for C++ designed to combine an obvious, user-friendly interface with the speed of optimized libraries like BLAS and LAPACK. ###

**Note:** This project had previously been hosted at [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tmv-cpp/).  I will keep posting updates there, but if you have any issues to report, I would prefer that you post them here.

There are two email groups that you might want to consider joining:
  * [tmv-discuss](http://groups.google.com/group/tmv-discuss) is for people who would like to participate in discussions about new features, API changes, and other related topics.
  * [tmv-announce](http://groups.google.com/group/tmv-announce) is for people who just want to know when a new version is released.  There will be exactly one email per TMV version (at a typical rate of one every 6-12 months).

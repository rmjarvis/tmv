Changes from version 0.73 to 0.74:
(See the History section in the full documentation for changes from previous
versions to 0.73.)

This release just updates the code to be compatible with the new updates to
the C++ standard, known as c++11, c++14, and the upcoming c++17 (technically
maybe still c++1z, but gcc already calls it c++17).  The code is now tested
to compile and run properly using any of these standards as well as c++03
and c++98 using g++ 6.2.0.

Thanks to Dominique Orban (@dpo) for posting Issue #22 alerting me to the
compilation errors using g++-6 prompting this update.

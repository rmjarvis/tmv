Changes from version 0.74 to 1.00:
(See the History section in the full documentation for changes from previous
versions to 0.74.)

This release was a complete rewrite from scratch, which should be significantly
faster for most use cases.  In particular, it is normally much faster for
SmallMatrix and SmallVector, since it uses specialized algorithms for many
of the specific small values of M,N.

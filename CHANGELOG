Changes from version 0.73 to 0.74:
(See the History section in the full documentation for changes from previous
versions to 0.73.)

This release just updates the code to be compatible with the new updates to
the C++ standard, known as c++11, c++14, and the upcoming c++17 (technically
maybe still c++1z, but gcc calls it c++17).  The code is now tested to compile
and run properly using any of these standards, as well as continuing to work
with both c++03 and c++98, using g++ 6.2.0.  (Other compilers such as clang++
and icpc also continue to work.)

Thanks to Dominique Orban (@dpo) for posting Issue #22 alerting me to the
compilation errors using g++-6 prompting this update.

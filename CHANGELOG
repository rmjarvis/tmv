Changes from version 0.75 to 0.76:
(See the History section in the full documentation for changes from previous
versions to 0.75.)

This release fixes some compiling issues with g++-14.  Specifically that it doesn't
allow complex<int> to be copied to complex<long double> without explicit conversion.
There is no change to any functionality.

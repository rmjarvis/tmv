Bug Fixes:

- Removed an extraneous 16 bytes of memory usage from SmallVector. (#12)
- Gives an error if PREFIX is the source directory (rather than just 
  failing to work properly). (#13)
- Fixed compiler warnings from newer versions of clang++.
- Changed tmv-version to a simple echo line rather than the complicated
  thing we used to have that stopped working when we switched from svn
  to git. (#20)

Build updates:

- Added support for OpenMP for clang v3.7+.
- Improved automatic library selection for MKL. (#15)
- Fixed broken USE_UNKNOWN_VARS feature. (#16)
- No longer includes $PREFIX/include in the include path by default.
  Use scons IMPORT_PREFIX=true if you want to include it. (#17)
- Added LINKFLAGS as an explicit option. (#21)
- No longer officially support Visual C++ installation.  I suspect it still
  works, but I no longer include it in my list of tested systems.

Documatation updates:

- Documented the sort order for eigenvectors returned by Eigen and singular
  values returned SV_Decompose. (#14)
